# TicTacToe-PROCEDURAL MUSIC
A simple Tic Tac Toe game to have an overview around Python language and Pygame module!

*Now with procedural midi music!*

This was created as a demo in less than a day for the Dagstuhl Seminar 24261 "Computational Creativity for Game Development", during the workshop on "Meaningful Acoustics for
Boardgames". The group included Filippo Carnovalini, Leonie Kallabis, Greta Hoffmann, Chengpeng Hu, Mathias Müller-Brockhausen, and Mike Preuss. 

Leonie Kallabis created the updated graphical assets. Her and Mathias Müller-Brockhausen contributed to the code modifications. The procedural music was coded by Filippo Carnovalini. Greta Hoffmann provided SFX. All memebers of the group contributed to the conceptualization and realization of this demo. 


## Using the application
- Clone GitHub repository
- (optional) create virtual environment via venv
- Install Pygame: `pip install pygame`
- Install rtmidi `pip install python-rtmidi`
- Install mido `pip install mido`

- You need to have something to receive midi messages to hear anything. For example, simplesynth.

- Run: `python main.py`

- Check what output the game has chosen for midi to select it in simplesynth (or whatever program you use)
